11 1. That § 58.1-322.03, as it is currently effective and as it may become effective, of the Code of
12 Virginia is amended and reenacted as follows:
13 § 58.1-322.03. (For contingent effective date, see Acts 2023, Sp. Sess. I, ch. 1, cl. 22).

16 1. a. The amount allowable for itemized deductions for federal income tax purposes where the
17 taxpayer has elected for the taxable year to itemize deductions on his federal return, but reduced by the
18 amount of income taxes imposed by the Commonwealth or any other taxing jurisdiction and deducted
19 on such federal return and increased by an amount that, when added to the amount deducted under
20 § 170 of the Internal Revenue Code for mileage, results in a mileage deduction at the state level for
21 such purposes at a rate of 18 cents per mile; or
22 b. Provided that the taxpayer has not itemized deductions for the taxable year on his federal income
23 tax return: (i) for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2019, and on and after January 1, 2026,

26 but before January 1, 2022, $4,500 for single individuals and $9,000 for married persons (one-half of

31 2026, $8,500 for single individuals and $17,000 for married persons (one-half of such amounts in the
32 case of a married individual filing a separate return). For purposes of this section, any person who may
33 be claimed as a dependent on another taxpayer's return for the taxable year may compute the deduction
34 only with respect to earned income.
35 2. a. A deduction in the amount of $930 for each personal exemption allowable to the taxpayer for
36 federal income tax purposes.
37 b. Each blind or aged taxpayer as defined under § 63(f) of the Internal Revenue Code shall be
38 entitled to an additional personal exemption in the amount of $800.
39 The additional deduction for blind or aged taxpayers allowed under this subdivision shall be
40 allowable regardless of whether the taxpayer itemizes deductions for the taxable year for federal income
41 tax purposes.

43 based under § 21 of the Internal Revenue Code for expenses for household and dependent care services
44 necessary for gainful employment.

49 b. A deduction in the amount of $12,000 for individuals born after January 1, 1939, who have

51 federal adjusted gross income exceeds $50,000 for single taxpayers or $75,000 for married taxpayers.

53 combined adjusted federal adjusted gross income of both spouses exceeds $75,000.
54 For the purposes of this subdivision, ""adjusted federal adjusted gross income"" means federal adjusted
55 gross income minus any benefits received under Title II of the Social Security Act and other benefits

63 provided in subdivision b, the amount deducted on any individual income tax return in any taxable year
64 shall be limited to $4,000 per prepaid tuition contract or college savings trust account. No deduction
65 shall be allowed pursuant to this subdivision 7 if such payments or contributions are deducted on the
66 purchaser's or contributor's federal income tax return. If the purchase price or annual contribution to a
67 college savings trust account exceeds $4,000, the remainder may be carried forward and subtracted in
68 future taxable years until the purchase price or college savings trust contribution has been fully
69 deducted; however, except as provided in subdivision b, in no event shall the amount deducted in any
70 taxable year exceed $4,000 per contract or college savings trust account. Notwithstanding the statute of
71 limitations on assessments contained in § 58.1-312, any deduction taken hereunder shall be subject to

81 attained age 70 shall not be subject to the limitation that the amount of the deduction not exceed $4,000
82 per prepaid tuition contract or college savings trust account in any taxable year. Such taxpayer shall be
83 allowed a deduction for the full amount paid for the contract or contributed to a college savings trust
84 account, less any amounts previously deducted.
85 8. The total amount an individual actually contributed in funds to the Virginia Public School
86 Construction Grants Program and Fund, established in Chapter 11.1 (§ 22.1-175.1 et seq.) of Title 22.1,

96 provided that the individual has not claimed a deduction for federal income tax purposes, or, for taxable
97 years beginning before January 1, 2014, a credit under § 58.1-339.11. For taxable years beginning on
98 and after January 1, 2014, no such deduction for long-term health care insurance premiums paid by the
99 individual during the taxable year shall be allowed if the individual has claimed a federal income tax
100 deduction for such taxable year for long-term health care insurance premiums paid by him.
101 11. Contract payments to a producer of quota tobacco or a tobacco quota holder, or their spouses, as
102 provided under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-357), but only to the extent that such
103 payments have not been subtracted pursuant to subsection D of § 58.1-402, as follows:
104 a. If the payment is received in installment payments, then the recognized gain may be subtracted in
105 the taxable year immediately following the year in which the installment payment is received.
106 b. If the payment is received in a single payment, then 10 percent of the recognized gain may be
107 subtracted in the taxable year immediately following the year in which the single payment is received.

99 librarians in middle schools, one-half time to 299 students, one full-time at 300 students, two full-time
100 at 1,000 students; librarians in high schools, one half-time to 299 students, one full-time at 300 students,
101 two full-time at 1,000 students. Local school divisions that employ a sufficient number of librarians to
102 meet this staffing requirement may assign librarians to schools within the division according to the area
103 of greatest need, regardless of whether such schools are elementary, middle, or secondary; and
104 4. School counselors, one full-time equivalent position per 325 students in grades kindergarten
105 through 12.
106 However, in order to meet the staffing requirements set forth in this subdivision, any local school
107 board (i) may employ, under a provisional license issued by the Department for three school years with
108 an allowance for an additional two-year extension with the approval of the division superintendent, any
109 professional counselor licensed by the Board of Counseling, clinical social worker licensed by the Board
110 of Social Work, psychologist licensed by the Board of Psychology, or other licensed counseling
111 professional with appropriate experience and training, provided that any such individual makes progress
112 toward completing the requirements for full licensure as a school counselor during such period of
113 employment or (ii) in the event that the school board does not receive any application from a licensed
114 school counselor, professional counselor, clinical social worker, or psychologist or another licensed
115 counseling professional with appropriate experience and training to fill a school counselor vacancy in the
116 school division, may enter into an annual contract with another entity for the provision of school
117 counseling services by a licensed professional counselor, clinical social worker, or psychologist or
118 another licensed counseling professional with appropriate experience and training. Local school boards
119 that employ a sufficient number of individuals to meet the staffing requirements set forth in this
120 subdivision may assign such individuals to schools within the division according to the area of greatest

121 need, regardless of whether such schools are elementary, middle, or high schools.
122 I. Local school boards shall employ five full-time equivalent positions per 1,000 students in grades
123 kindergarten through five to serve as elementary resource teachers in art, music, and physical education.
124 J. Local school boards shall employ two full-time equivalent positions per 1,000 students in grades
125 kindergarten through 12, one to provide technology support and one to serve as an instructional
126 technology resource teacher.
127 To provide flexibility, school divisions may use the state and local funds for instructional technology
128 resource teachers to employ a data coordinator position, an instructional technology resource teacher
129 position, or a data coordinator/instructional resource teacher blended position. The data coordinator
130 position is intended to serve as a resource to principals and classroom teachers in the area of data
131 analysis and interpretation for instructional and school improvement purposes, as well as for overall data
132 management and administration of state assessments. School divisions using these funds in this manner
133 shall employ only instructional personnel licensed by the Board.
134 K. Local school boards may employ additional positions that exceed these minimal staffing
135 requirements. These additional positions may include, but are not limited to, those funded through the
136 state's incentive and categorical programs as set forth in the appropriation act.
137 L. A combined school, such as kindergarten through 12, shall meet at all grade levels the staffing
138 requirements for the highest grade level in that school; this requirement shall apply to all staff, except
139 for school counselors or certain other licensed individuals as set forth in subdivision H 4, and shall be
140 based on the school's total enrollment. The Board may grant waivers from these staffing levels upon
141 request from local school boards seeking to implement experimental or innovative programs that are not
142 consistent with these staffing levels.
143 M. School boards shall, however, annually, on or before December 31, report to the public (i) the
144 actual pupil/teacher ratios in elementary school classrooms in the local school division by school for the
145 current school year; and (ii) the actual pupil/teacher ratios in middle school and high school in the local
146 school division by school for the current school year. Actual pupil/teacher ratios shall include only the
147 teachers who teach the grade and class on a full-time basis and shall exclude resource personnel. School
148 boards shall report pupil/teacher ratios that include resource teachers in the same annual report. Any
149 classes funded through the voluntary kindergarten through third grade class size reduction program shall
150 be identified as such classes. Any classes having waivers to exceed the requirements of this subsection
151 shall also be identified. Schools shall be identified; however, the data shall be compiled in a manner to
152 ensure the confidentiality of all teacher and pupil identities.
153 N. Students enrolled in a public school on a less than full-time basis shall be counted in ADM in the
154 relevant school division. Students who are either (i) enrolled in a nonpublic school or (ii) receiving
155 home instruction pursuant to § 22.1-254.1, and who are enrolled in public school on a less than full-time
156 basis in any mathematics, science, English, history, social science, career and technical education, fine
157 arts, foreign language, or health education or physical education course shall be counted in the ADM in
158 the relevant school division on a pro rata basis as provided in the appropriation act. Each such course
159 enrollment by such students shall be counted as 0.25 in the ADM; however, no such nonpublic or home
160 school student shall be counted as more than one-half a student for purposes of such pro rata
161 calculation. Such calculation shall not include enrollments of such students in any other public school
162 courses.
163 O. Each school board shall provide at least three specialized student support positions per 1,000
164 students. For purposes of this subsection, specialized student support positions include school social
165 workers, school psychologists, school nurses, licensed behavior analysts, licensed assistant behavior
166 analysts, and other licensed health and behavioral positions, which may either be employed by the
167 school board or provided through contracted services.
168 In order to fill vacant school psychologist positions, any local school board may employ, under a
169 provisional license issued by the Department for three school years with an allowance for an additional
170 two-year extension with the approval of the division superintendent, clinical psychologists licensed by
171 the Board of Psychology, provided that any such individual makes progress toward completing the
172 requirements for full licensure as a school psychologist during such period of employment.
173 P. Each local school board shall provide those support services that are necessary for the efficient
174 and cost-effective operation and maintenance of its public schools.
175 For the purposes of this title, unless the context otherwise requires, ""support services positions"" shall
176 include the following:
177 1. Executive policy and leadership positions, including school board members, superintendents and
178 assistant superintendents;
179 2. Fiscal and human resources positions, including fiscal and audit operations;
180 3. Student support positions, including (i) social work administrative positions not included in
181 subsection O; (ii) school counselor administrative positions not included in subdivision H 4; (iii)

186 media positions not included in subdivision H 3;
187 5. Technology professional positions not included in subsection J;
188 6. Operation and maintenance positions, including facilities; pupil transportation positions; operation

193 300 students; clerical personnel in middle schools; one full-time and one additional full-time for each
194 600 students beyond 200 students and one full-time for the library at 750 students; clerical personnel in
195 high schools; one full-time and one additional full-time for each 600 students beyond 200 students and
196 one full-time for the library at 750 students. Local school divisions that employ a sufficient number of
197 school-based clerical personnel to meet this staffing requirement may assign the clerical personnel to
198 schools within the division according to the area of greatest need, regardless of whether such schools are
199 elementary, middle, or secondary.
200 Pursuant to the appropriation act, support services shall be funded from basic school aid.
201 School divisions may use the state and local funds for support services to provide additional
202 instructional services.
203 Q. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, when determining the assignment of instructional
204 and other licensed personnel in subsections C through J, a local school board shall not be required to
205 include full-time students of approved virtual school programs.

16 and other professional personnel.
17 B. School boards shall employ licensed instructional personnel qualified in the relevant subject areas.

21 licensed individuals as set forth in subdivision H 4, and librarians, that are not greater than the
22 following ratios: (i) 24 to one in kindergarten with no class being larger than 29 students; if the average
23 daily membership in any kindergarten class exceeds 24 pupils, a full-time teacher's aide shall be
24 assigned to the class; (ii) 24 to one in grades one, two, and three with no class being larger than 30
25 students; (iii) 25 to one in grades four through six with no class being larger than 35 students; and (iv)
26 24 to one in English classes in grades six through 12. After September 30 of any school year, anytime
27 the number of students in a class exceeds the class size limit established by this subsection, the local
28 school division shall notify the parent of each student in such class of such fact no later than 10 days
29 after the date on which the class exceeded the class size limit. Such notification shall state the reason
30 that the class size exceeds the class size limit and describe the measures that the local school division
31 will take to reduce the class size to comply with this subsection.
32 Within its regulations governing special education programs, the Board shall seek to set pupil/teacher
33 ratios for pupils with intellectual disability that do not exceed the pupil/teacher ratios for self-contained
34 classes for pupils with specific learning disabilities.
35 Further, school boards shall assign instructional personnel in a manner that produces schoolwide
36 ratios of students in average daily memberships to full-time equivalent teaching positions of 21 to one in
37 middle schools and high schools. School divisions shall provide all middle and high school teachers with
38 one planning period per day or the equivalent, unencumbered of any teaching or supervisory duties.
39 D. Each local school board shall employ with state and local basic, special education, gifted, and
40 career and technical education funds a minimum number of licensed, full-time equivalent instructional
41 personnel for each 1,000 students in average daily membership (ADM) as set forth in the appropriation
42 act.
43 E. In addition to the positions supported by basic aid and in support of regular school year programs
44 of prevention, intervention, and remediation, state funding, pursuant to the appropriation act, shall be
45 provided to fund certain full-time equivalent instructional positions for each 1,000 students in grades K
46 through 12 who are identified as needing prevention, intervention, and remediation services. State
47 funding for prevention, intervention, and remediation programs provided pursuant to this subsection and

71 To provide flexibility in the instruction of English language learner students who have limited
72 English proficiency and who are at risk of not meeting state accountability standards, school divisions
73 may use state and local funds from the Standards of Quality Prevention, Intervention, and
74 Remediation account to employ additional English language learner teachers or dual language
75 teachers to provide instruction to identified limited English proficiency students. Using these funds in
76 this manner is intended to supplement the instructional services provided in this section. School
77 divisions using the SOQ Prevention, Intervention, and Remediation funds in this manner shall employ
78 only instructional personnel licensed by the Board.
79 G. In addition to the full-time equivalent positions required elsewhere in this section, each local
80 school board shall employ one reading specialist for each 550 students in kindergarten through grade

92 reading specialists to provide the required reading intervention services. School divisions using the Early
93 Reading Intervention Initiative funds in this manner shall employ only instructional personnel licensed
94 by the Board. Local school divisions that employ a sufficient number of reading specialists to meet this
95 staffing standard may assign reading specialists to grade levels according to grade levels with greatest
96 need, regardless of the individual staffing standards established for grades kindergarten through five and
97 six through eight.
98 H. Each local school board shall employ, at a minimum, the following full-time equivalent positions
99 for any school that reports fall membership, according to student enrollment:

125 counseling professional with appropriate experience and training to fill a school counselor vacancy in the
126 school division, may enter into an annual contract with another entity for the provision of school
127 counseling services by a licensed professional counselor, clinical social worker, or psychologist or

133 kindergarten through five to serve as elementary resource teachers in art, music, and physical education.
134 J. Local school boards shall employ two full-time equivalent positions per 1,000 students in grades
135 kindergarten through 12, one to provide technology support and one to serve as an instructional

17 shall not be construed to provide express authorization.
18 Nothing in this section shall prohibit a locality from adopting workplace rules relating to terms and

20 
21 . However, no locality shall adopt any workplace rule, other than for the purposes of a

SECOND REGULAR SESSION-2024
Legislative Document No. 2176
S.P. 927 In Senate, January 23, 2024
An Act to Ensure the Workers' Compensation Board's Allocations
Are Properly Funded
Reported by Senator TIPPING of Penobscot for the Workers' Compensation Board
pursuant to the Maine Revised Statutes, Title 39-A, section 152, subsection 11.
Reference to the Committee on Labor and Housing suggested and ordered printed pursuant
to Joint Rule 218.
DAREK M. GRANT
Secretary of the Senate
Printed on recycled paper
1 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:
2 Sec. 1. 39-A MRSA §154, sub-§6, ¶A, as amended by PL 2023, c. 17, Pt. R, §1,
3 is further amended to read:
4 A. The assessments levied under this section may not be designed to produce more
5 than $14,700,000 beginning in the 2023‑24 fiscal year 
6 
7 . Assessments collected that exceed the limit by a
8 margin of more than 10% must be used to reduce the assessment that is paid by insured
9 employers pursuant to subsection 3. Any amount collected above the board's allocated
10 budget and within the 10% margin must be used to create a reserve of up to 1/4 of the
11 board's annual budget.
12 SUMMARY
13 This bill amends the provision of law governing the Workers' Compensation Board
14 Administrative Fund to ensure the board will be able to fund expenditures allocated by the
15 Legislature and maintain its reserve. The bill removes current statutory language that
16 places a specific dollar amount on the maximum value of assessments that may be levied
17 from insured employers and replaces it with language providing that assessments levied
18 may not be designed to produce more revenue than is sufficient for the Workers'
19 Compensation Board to fund the expenditures allocated by the Legislature and to maintain
20 a reserve of up to 1/4 of the board's annual budget. The bill retains language from current
21 law that requires that any funds collected above the maximum assessment that exceed a
22 margin of 10% be used to reduce the assessments paid by insured employers.

101 CONCERNING THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY, AND, IN CONNECTION
102 THEREWITH, EXPANDING THE SCOPE OF THE TASK FORCE FOR
103 THE CONSIDERATION OF FACIAL RECOGNITION SERVICES TO
104 INCLUDE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND BIOMETRIC
105 TECHNOLOGY, ADDING MEMBERS TO THE TASK FORCE WHO ARE

not reflect any amendments that may be subsequently adopted. If this bill
passes third reading in the house of introduction, a bill summary that
applies to the reengrossed version of this bill will be available at
http://leg.colorado.gov/.)
Joint Technology Committee. The bill updates the membership
and issues of study for the task force for the consideration of facial
recognition services and changes the name of the task force to the
biometric technology and artificial intelligence policy task force (task
force). The task force will expand from 15 to 17 members and now
includes a member who is an expert in generative artificial intelligence
technology; a member who is an expert in social media, biometric
technology, or artificial intelligence technology; and a member who is an
advocate for youth safety and privacy. The member who represents the
Colorado bureau of investigation will be replaced.
The bill updates the issues of study of the task force to include
artificial intelligence technology and biometric technology in addition to
facial recognition technology. The scope of the task force is expanded to
include a focus on the use of these emerging technologies generally rather
than their use by only state and local government agencies.
The bill adds exceptions to the moratorium on schools using facial
recognition technologies, which would allow a school to use facial
recognition technologies in certain circumstances.
The bill modifies the reporting requirements for state agencies that
use facial recognition services so that agency records are maintained by
the agency and subject to inspection and review by the office of
information technology.
